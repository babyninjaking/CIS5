1)
**Compare to function**

2)
int bNum; 	//number of books
int points;	//number of points

cout << "how many books buy?"

	points = 0

	points = 15

	points = 30

3)
//Similar to 2, just use multiple cases for the two fees
flaot bal, cFee, nBal;
int cNum, mFee, lbFee;

cin >> bal >> cNum;

if (bal < 400)
	lbFee = 15;

	cFee = cNum * 0.04

	cFee = ...

cout << Bank statement bla bla bla



4)
Similar to #1, but the measurement is the time and the outputs are the total info of the runners.
Use arrays as variable input, only three names, use for loop as an index indicator
	Two arrays of size 3, one for names one for number.
	Only check number array for order, swap the order.
		Review sorting (Selection/isertion)
	Change array orders at the same time to maintian cosistancy.


5)
Easy if else question.


6)
Easy if else quesion.


7)
Confused


8)
Use string functions to identify uset input
Assign elements to each sign.
if (ele1 = ele2)
	compatible
else
	breakup
